In this clone app, I only mimic the key features such as authentication, reservations, liking an accomodation, and booking a reservation",

The UI may not be fully optimized but I formulated with the help of simple linear algebra on how to build the sequencing logic on these biological data. Throughout my programming journey, this app is one of the things that make me understand object oriented programming and how to brought me strong foundation on how software works. This app is open to the public as I uploaded the desktop installer on SourceForge.",

On my own opinion, data is the building blocks of a software which has the same analogy as atoms in the chemistry field or cells in life science. In conclusion to that, understanding how to perform data analysis and its interpretation is an essential skill that can create effective software applications.",
