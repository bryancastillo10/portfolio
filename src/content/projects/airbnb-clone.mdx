🌐 Project: **Airbnb-Clone**

🧠 **Problem Statement**

When I was just starting out to learn on full-stack development, I built this
project by following a tutorial to simulate the core functionality of a booking
platform like Airbnb. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with
authentication, form handling, API routing, deeper understanding on React
components and hooks, and database modeling using a full-stack framework.
