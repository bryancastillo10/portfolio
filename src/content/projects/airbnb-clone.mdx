## 🧠 Problem Statement

When I was just starting out to learn on full-stack development, I built this
project by following a tutorial to simulate the core functionality of a booking
platform like Airbnb. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with
authentication, form handling, API routing, deeper understanding on React
components and hooks, and database modeling using a full-stack framework.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Prisma)
- **Authentication:** NextAuth (with Credentials and OAuth)
- **Maps & Location:** Leaflet.js

## 🚀 Key Features

- Create and manage property listings
- Bookings with calendar date range selection
- User pages to view reservation & listings
- Next-Auth based authentication with secure password hashing & session handling

## 🧩 Challenges & Learnings

- **Reusable Components & Props Handling :** This project deepened my
  understanding of how to optimize component reuse by effectively passing props.
  I also explored conditional rendering patterns using state enums, a feature
  unique to TypeScript that's not available in plain JavaScript—helping me write
  more maintainable UI logic.

- **Client vs Server Components in NextJS:** I gained clarity on the differences
  between client-side and server-side components in the App Router paradigm. It
  taught me when to choose one over the other depending on the interaction,
  performance, or rendering requirements.

- **Database Modeling with Prisma & NoSQL:** Although the tutorial used a NoSQL
  database (MongoDB), it helped me understand how to design flexible
  schemas—including nullable fields and relational references. I also learned
  how Prisma abstracts database operations while supporting both SQL and NoSQL
  database backends.

- **Form Handling with React-Hook-Form:** I learned how to use react-hook-form
  for managing form states efficiently—across auth flows, property creation, and
  booking logic. Handling complex types like DateTime on both the frontend and
  backend gave me insight into working with real-world form data.

- **Responsive Design:** This was a hands-on exercise in utility-first styling.
  By building every UI component with Tailwind, I improved my ability to craft
  responsive layouts quickly and reduced the need for custom CSS.
