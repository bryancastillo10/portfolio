## 🧠 Problem Statement

Water quality monitoring is a challenging aspect in the field of environmental
engineering and it is essential to gain insights on the behavioral pattern of a
natural water body or an engineered system. Through this app, a seamless
experience of adding target monitoring site and adding water quality data with
customizable thresholds can help engineers, researchers, or any technical
personnel in the water industry perform their monitoring activity efficiently.

## 🛖 Software Architecture and Design Decisions

This web application was designed with cost-efficiency and scalability in mind,
leveraging **free-tier services** suitable for a portfolio project:

- **MongoDB Atlas** was used as the cloud-hosted NoSQL database, offering
  seamless integration and scalability for document-based storage.
- **Cloudinary** handles image uploads (e.g., profile pictures and site images),
  which is practical given its free storage tier.
- **Nodemailer** with SMTP is used solely for password reset functionality,
  ensuring minimal network traffic.

On the frontend, tool selection was guided by a balance between **frequency of
use** and **development efficiency**. Whenever a feature required excessive
boilerplate or complexity in raw React, a dependency was introduced to
streamline development:

- **React Redux** is used for global state management.
- **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)** manages API state and caching efficiently.
- **TanStack Table** handles dynamic table rendering and manipulation.
- **Recharts** provides visualization capabilities, particularly for dashboard
  metrics.
- **Tailwind CSS** is used exclusively for styling, with no external UI
  component libraries, allowing for full control over custom design.

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

### Client (Frontend)

The `src/` directory is organized for scalability and maintainability:

- `components/`: Shared UI components across the app.
- `lib/`: External libraries or setups (e.g., API clients).
- `hooks/`: Reusable global hooks.
- `utils/`: Global utility functions.
- `assets/`: Static resources (images, fonts, etc.).
- `features/`: Modular folders scoped per feature (e.g., `auth`, `dashboard`,
  `user`) containing:
  - Local components
  - API requests
  - Custom hooks
  - Context providers

### Server (Backend)

The backend follows a hybrid of **feature-based structure** and **clean
architecture principles**, emphasizing separation of concerns:

📁`infrastructure/`: Low-level concerns like:

- Database (Prisma)
- Server setup (Express)
- Middlewares
- Custom error handling

📁`features/`: Each domain feature (e.g., `auth`, `user`, `dashboard`) is
divided into:

- `routes`
- `controller`
- `service`
- `repository`
- `config`
- `interfaces`
- `entity`

This architecture keeps business logic **decoupled**, enhances
**maintainability**, and **eases debugging and testing**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- User Role Management
- Readily Available Data Template
- Monitoring Site Data Management
- Intuitive Water Quality Table
- Customizable Parameter Thresholds
