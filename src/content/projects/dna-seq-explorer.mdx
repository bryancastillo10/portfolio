## üß† Problem Statement

This **React-Typescript & Python-FastAPI** web application helps life science
enthusiasts in performing basic analysis of fundamental biomolecules such as
**DNA, RNA, & protein**. It includes features such as calculating sequence
parameters, predicting taxa and DNA type, as well as performing pariwise
sequence alignments. This app also demonstrates my knowledge in the fundamentals
of machine learning and data science that can produce artificial intelligence
models that can be used to solve real-world problems such as this analysis on
biological sequences.

  alt="dna-seq-explorer-architecture"

Steps in machine learning using Python in a Jupyter notebook environment include
**exploratory data analysis**, **data pre-processing**, **model training**, and
**model evaluation**. Each of these steps is vital for crafting an AI model and
requires some domain knowledge about the dataset. Since I have a background in
computational biology from my past research experiences, I was able to execute
these steps carefully.

The architecture of this app does not include storage system (no database), but
it offers a **report export feature** for saving the analysis results. For the
tech stacks, the client side is mainly built from React-Typescript, together
with Material UI, Tanstack Router, React-Query, and Zustand. Meanwhile, the
server side is powered by Python-FastAPI with libraries such as numpy,
reportlab, pydantic, and sci-kit learn.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Basic Sequence Analysis
- Advanced Sequence Analysis (AI-Powered Prediction)
- Dotplot Sequence alignment
- Local Pairwise Sequence Alignment (via Smith-Waterman Algorithm)
- Global Pairwise Sequence Alignment (via Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm)
