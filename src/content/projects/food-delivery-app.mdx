## 🧠 Problem Statement

In some rural areas in the Philippines, the use of food delivery platforms like
**Food Panda** and **Grab Food** remains underdeveloped, despite the growing
presence of local restaurant businesses within these communities. Recognizing
this gap, our team set out to build an effective and accessible food delivery
solution tailored for these underserved areas.

As the sole backend developer on the team, I was responsible for building the
entire server-side infrastructure. The current deployment serves as a
preliminary production release that demonstrates my contribution and provides a
foundation for the rest of the team.

The backend was developed using **GoLang**, **Gin framework**, and **GORM ORM**
which provides a modern, reliable and scalable API to connect **Customers**,
**Drivers**, and **Shop Owners**. It follows **clean architecture principles**
to ensure separation of concerns and long-term maintainability.

With built-in support for **real-time order updates using WebSockets**, the
system ensures seamless communication across all roles. While some members of
the team are still in the early stages of learning frontend development, I
continue to provide guidance as we work toward completing the full application
collaboratively.

## REST API Design for Food Delivery Transaction Feature

  alt="food-delivery-transaction"
/>

This backend is structured using a **Clean Architecture** approach, ensuring
clear separation of concerns and long-term maintainability. The project is
organized into the following key layers:

### 🧩 Feature-Based Internal Modules

Each feature (e.g. `auth`, `order`, `restaurant`, `user`, `notifications`) lives
inside the `internal/` directory, and contains:

- `handler.go` – defines HTTP handlers for the Gin router
- `service.go` – implements business logic and use cases
- `repo.go` – interacts with the database via GORM
- `dto.go` – defines data transfer objects for request and response schemas

This structure makes each feature independently testable, easy to maintain, and
ready for scaling.

### ⚙️ Infrastructure & Application Setup

The core infrastructure code is separated outside the `internal/` folder and
includes:

`routes/` – centralized route definitions for all endpoints -`connectDb.go`
–handles PostgreSQL database connection -`connectRedis.go` – manages Redis
connection (for OTP feature) -`ginServer.go` – initializes and configures the
Gin engine -`syncDb.go` – automates schema sync with GORM -`config/` –
centralized config for:

`loadEnv.go` – environment variable management

`cors.go` – CORS policy setup

`migration.go` – optional migration utilities

`models/` - a separate folder dedicated for all the database schema declaration

### 🛰️ Real-Time Support

**WebSockets** were used to provide live updates about the order between owners,
drivers, and customers

This architecture follows idiomatic Go with clean architecture principles,
making it ideal for teams even with varying skill levels to contribute and learn
effectively.

## 🚀 Key Features

🔐 **Custom Authentication Flow**

- **Customers** sign up via **OAuth** (e.g. Google) and must pass **SMS-based
  OTP verification** before gaining access
- **Drivers** and **Shop Owners** cannot self-register wherein they are created
  and managed by an **Admin** via protected endpoints

🛡️ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Routes are protected and filtered depending on the authenticated user's role.
- Each role (Customer, Driver, Owner, Admin) has access only to the appropriate
  subset of API functionality

🔁 **Full Food Delivery Transaction API**

- **Customers**: browse restaurants, place orders, track order status
- **Shop Owners**: manage their restaurants, update menu items, accept/reject
  orders
- **Drivers**: accept delivery assignments, update delivery status
- **Admin**: onboard new owners and drivers, monitor platform activity

📡 **Real-Time Order Tracking with WebSockets**

- Instant updates between Customer, Owner, and Driver as the order progresses
  from creation to delivery
- WebSocket endpoints designed for role-specific listeners (e.g. live updates
  for incoming orders or delivery status changes) x

## ⚒️ Contributions

- Collaborated with the team in conceptualizing the **technical side** of the
  project, providing architectural insights, API structure, and data modeling
  strategies
- Took full ownership as the **sole backend developer**, building the entire
  server-side logic using **GoLang**, **Gin**, and **GORM**, following clean
  architecture principles
- Designed and implemented the **database schema**, business logic, and
  **role-based access control**, including a distinct authentication flow for
  customers, and other roles
- Deployed the backend to production using **Fly.io**, managing environment
  configurations and database synchronization workflows
- While capable of frontend development, I focused on backend responsibilities
  to allow team members to grow their frontend skills. I will just provide them
  **technical guidance and mentorship** throughout the development process
