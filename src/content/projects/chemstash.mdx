## 🧠 Problem Statement

Managing chemicals has been one of the most important tasks in maintaining a
chemical laboratory especially in an industry wherein there is a continuous
consumption of this supply for chemical analysis. This is a project idea of mine
in solving real world problems and found a co-developer that is also interested
in grasping more knowledge in web development, so we worked together in building
this application. This project is vital to my journey in full stack development
even though there are still a lot of improvements needed in this current project
but this gave me an introduction to full-stack development, version control
systems, and some of the best practices in software development project
planning.
