## 🧠 Problem Statement

Managing chemicals is one of the most important tasks in maintaining a chemical
laboratory, especially in industries where there is continuous consumption of
supplies for chemical analysis. This project was my idea to solve a real-world
problem, and I found a co-developer who was also interested in learning more
about web development. We worked together to build this application. This
project was vital to my journey in full-stack development. Although there are
still many improvements to be made, it gave me an introduction to full-stack
development, version control systems, and best practices in software project
planning.

## ⚒️ Contributions

- Provided the **project idea 💡** to solve a real-world problem in the chemical
  industry and discussed the project requirements and user flow with my
  co-developer
- Developed sections of the frontend (dashboard, table, drawer forms) and
  handled API calls using JavaScript fetch
- Data modeling and implementation of some business logic in the API
- Followed the Figma design provided by my co-developer to construct the layout
  and styles using Tailwind CSS

## 🧩 Challenges & Learnings

This was my first full-stack development project. As a beginner, it was quite
challenging to handle the tasks, but the **most important thing I learned** was
to view features/problems as large tasks and then technically split them into
simpler, solvable problems to fully implement a feature.

Version control in collaboration is vital. This project gave me firsthand
experience in best practices: starting a branch, committing code changes,
pushing changes from local to remote, creating pull requests, and merging
changes.

Although I had practiced following Figma designs on `frontendmentor.io`, this
was one of my first projects where I engaged with a newly crafted design by my
co-developer. Since our Figma file was personal, I was able to style our website
in a **pixel-perfect** way, closely following his design.
